# angular-require-seed

A fully lazily loaded Angular web application using Require JS. A beginner friendly template for creating an advanced, fast experience.

This serves as a start for any large-scale web application. It features an understandable hiearchy and examples. It brings structure to any web application.

It's fully lazily loaded, meaning that resources are loaded after the main page has finished loading and that no resources are loaded unless they are needed. This allows for a fast experience with minimal initial load time. Every resource, view or partial is broken down to a module including it's HTML, JS and CSS. This results easy management as the application grows.
